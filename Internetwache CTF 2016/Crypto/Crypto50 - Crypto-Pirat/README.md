# crypto50 - 'Crypto-Pirat'
    Did the East German Secret Police see a Pirat on the sky? Help me find out! 

    Hint: We had 9 planets from 1930â€“2006... 

    Hint2: Each planet has a number. (There's a table on a well-known website).After that you might be interested in ciphers used by the secret police.
