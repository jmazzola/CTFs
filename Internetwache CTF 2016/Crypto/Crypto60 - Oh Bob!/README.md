# crypto60 - 'Oh Bob!'
    Alice wants to send Bob a confidential message. They both remember the crypto lecture about RSA. So Bob uses openssl to create key pairs. Finally, Alice encrypts the message with Bob's public keys and sends it to Bob. Clever Eve was able to intercept it. Can you help Eve to decrypt the message?
