# web70 - 'The Secret Store'
    We all love secrets. Without them, our lives would be dull. A student wrote a secure secret store, however he was babbling about problems with the database. Maybe I shouldn't use the 'admin' account. 

    Hint1: Account deletion is intentional. 
    Hint2: I can't handle long usernames.
