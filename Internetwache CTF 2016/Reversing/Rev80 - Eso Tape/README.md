# rev80 - 'Eso Tape'
    I once took a nap on my keyboard. I dreamed of a brand new language, but I could not decipher it nor get its meaning. Can you help me? Hint: Replace the spaces with either '{' or '}' in the solution. 

    Hint: Interpreters don't help. Operations write to the current index.
